                    The Hatfields and McCoys were two families who were separated along the Tug River. 
                    The Tug River separates Kentucky from the southwest part of West Verginia. 
                    William Anderson “Devil Anse” Hatfield, born in 1839, is the patriarch of the Hatfields family. 
                    Randolph McCoy, born in 1825, is the patriarch of the McCoys family. 
                    Devil Anse and his family lived in West Virginia, to the north of the Tug River, while the McCoys lived in Kentucky which is to the south of the Tug River. 
                    Both fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War and even were in the same task force for some time. 
                    Anse’s timbering operations were the main source for his family’s wealth, while the McCoys were more of a lower-middle-class family. 
                    However they both were avid farmers who owned heaps of land.

                        The feud started with the killing of Asa Harmon McCoy. Asa Harmon McCoy was part of the McCoy family who worked with the Union(Winning Side) during the Civil War. As a result, the Wildcats killed Asa as being a traitor to the Confederates. The Wildcats were a local militia group that contained individuals from the Hatfields group and had Devil Anse in it. This was the first conflict between the two families. No one was prosecuted for the killing. Though this is the first recorded incident of the McCoys and Hatfields, more than a decade would pass before the feud truly begins.

                            Relations between the two families continued to sour over the next few years until finally something major happened, a dispute over a single hog. In 1878, Randolph McCoy accused Floyd Hatfield of stealing their hog, a valuable commodity at the time for middle-class farmers. Floyd Hatfield was a cousin of Devil Anse. The trial was held in McCoy territory and was overseen by Bill Staton. Bill Staton was a relative of the McCoys that was married to a Hatfield. After Bill said that Floyd was innocent, the McCoys were furious about this and saw this as a betrayal. Two years later, Staton was violently killed by the nephews of Randolph McCoy. The nephews stood trial for the murder but were free of charge for saying the murder was self defense.

                            Two months after Staton’s death, Devil Anse’s brother, Johnse Hatfield met Randolph McCoy’s daughter, Rosanna McCoy at an Election Day event. The two were in love and disappeared for hours together. Roseanna was scared to face her own family with this matter, so she stayed at the Hatfields residence for some time. Although they did love each other, it was clear that Johnse did not want to be with Roseanna anymore. So a few months after Roseanna’s pregnancy, Johnse moved on. In May 1881, Johnse married Nancy McCoy, who was Roseanna’s cousin. Historians say that Roseanna was never able to recover from this and her baby died of measles just a few months after he was born.

                            During the Election Day of 1882, three of Randolph McCoy’s sons got into a violent dispute between a brother of Devil Anse. Ellison Hatfield woke up from a drunken slumber and immediately insulted and attacked Tolbert McCoy. Tolbert, irritated by this, drew out his knives and attacked Ellison with his brother. Then another brother shot him. Police soon apprehended the McCoy brothers but the Hatfields intercepted them and took the McCoys to their territory. After the Hatfields heard the news of Ellison’s death, they tied the McCoys to some bushes and fired more than 50 shots, killing all three brothers. This is what historians call the turning point of the feud.

                            The McCoys were certainly angry after Randoph’s sons deaths so they placed a bounty on the Hatfields with the help of Perry Cline. The Hatfields were very mad about this, so in a last effort to end the fighting, they made a plan. Their plan was to attack and kill Randolph McCoy and his family by surprise. Led by Devil Anse’s son, Cap Hatfield and ally Jim Vance, a group of Hatfield men ambushed the McCoys’ home on New Year’s Day in 1888. Randolph escaped the chaos by running into the woods. However his son and daughter were both killed in the fighting. His wife afterwards got badly beaten by the Hatfields and was left with a broken skull.

                            A few days after the event unfolded, bounty hunters Frank Philips found Jim Vance and Cap Hatfield, killing Vance as Cap escaped. The Hatfields were furious about this and swore to have a final battle with Philips and the McCoys to end the feud once and for all. The two families met at Grapevine Creek which is on the West Virginia side of the Tug River. The two sides immediately began firing, the McCoy family assembled two groups and flanked the Hatfields on both sides for no escape. The McCoys killed many Hatfields and took nine prisoners. This is known to be the final battle between the two families and was only won through militaristic strategy.

                            Due to legal reasons, just putting the nine Hatfields in jail was not allowed, so many trials and court meetings were held to determine the fate of these nine Hatfields. The final trial to determine what would happen to these nine was in 1889. After the trials, eight of the Hatfields were sentenced to life in prison, one of them was not. Ellison Mounts, supposedly the son of Ellison Hatfield, was sentenced to death. Mounts was known to be mentally challenged, which explains why he could not give a proper justification to his actions in court. Although public executions were illegal, many people still came to watch the death of Mounts. Reports claim that his last words were: “They made me do it! The Hatfields made me do it!”

Three Hatfields were killed during the Battle for Grapevine Creek. Finally Ellison Mounts was killed during the final trials.

                                The two families united for a special Family Feud event. In which the cash prize was a pig which was kept on stage during the games. The pig is meant to signify the start of the feud which is the argument over a boar. Many tourists frequently visit the home sight of the feud to examine the relics that were left behind. In 2011, a Hatfields and McCoys dinner show opened in a place in Tennessee. There is a Hatfield and McCoy reunion festival that is held annually in June on a three-day weekend. The festival commemorates the feud with honor.
